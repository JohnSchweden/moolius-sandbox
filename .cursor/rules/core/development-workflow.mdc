# Development Workflow Rules

## Building and Running
- Use Turbo for build orchestration: `yarn build`
- Dev server: `yarn dev`
- Mobile: `yarn workspace expo-app start`
- Web: `yarn workspace next-app dev`

## Code Quality
- Always run TypeScript checks: `yarn type-check`
- Use ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Validate commits with lint-staged if configured

# Common Commands
- `yarn install` - Install dependencies
- `yarn dev` - Start development servers
- `yarn build` - Build all packages
- `yarn type-check` - Run TypeScript checks
- `yarn workspace <name> add <package>` - Add package to specific workspace
- `yarn workspace <name> run <script>` - Run script in specific workspace
