# Navigation Rules
- Use Solito for ALL navigation (web + native)
- NEVER use React Navigation directly
- NEVER use Next.js Link directly
- Define routes in packages/app/navigation
- Use typed navigation params with Zod

# Screen Structure
- Screens live in packages/app/features
- Use .tsx extension (never .native.tsx for screens)
- Wrap screens with Solito's createParam
