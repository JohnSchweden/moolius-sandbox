# Task List Management

Enhanced guidelines for cross-platform development task tracking.

## General Principles
- **Atomic tasks only**: Split compound actions into individual checkboxes
- **Single source of truth**: Each task appears in exactly one section
- **Immediate transitions**: Move tasks between sections when status changes
- **Platform awareness**: Tag platform-specific tasks with [Web], [Native], or [Both]
- **Zero ambiguity**: Parent items are headings, not checkboxes

## Structure Requirements

### Completed Tasks
- Only fully verified and tested items
- Include platform tags for reference
- Keep for sprint/milestone retrospectives

### In Progress Tasks  
- **Maximum 2-3 items** for focus
- Must be actively worked on (not just planned)
- Include current blocker/next step if stalled

### Future Tasks
- **Zero checked items** (move completed ones immediately)
- Prioritized order (most important first)
- Group related platform work together
- Include effort estimates: [S/M/L]

### Testing Pipeline
- Separate section for test-dependent tasks
- Link to specific test files or suites
- Track both unit and E2E test coverage

## Cross-Platform Considerations
- Tag platform scope: [Web], [Native], [Both]
- Dependencies between platforms clearly marked
- Shared package changes affect both platforms
- Database changes impact all clients

## Enhanced Template

```markdown
# [Feature/Component] Tasks

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Setup Tamagui component structure [Both]
- [x] Implement core logic with TypeScript [Both] 
- [x] Add unit tests with Vitest [Both]

## In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Implement native-specific gestures [Native]
  - Next: Add pan gesture handlers
  - Blocker: Need to test on iOS device

## Future Tasks
- [ ] Add web-specific keyboard shortcuts [Web] [S]
- [ ] Implement Supabase realtime sync [Both] [M]
- [ ] Add E2E tests for critical flows [Both] [L]
- [ ] Performance optimization with React.memo [Both] [S]

## Testing Pipeline
- [ ] Unit tests passing (packages/ui/components/Feature.test.tsx)
- [ ] Component tests with RTL (packages/app/features/Feature.test.tsx) 
- [ ] E2E Native (e2e/Feature.test.ts)
- [ ] E2E Web (tests/Feature.spec.ts)
