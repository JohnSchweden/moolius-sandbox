# Accessibility WCAG Guidelines

## Global Rules
- Provide text alternatives: images, icons, media.
- Maintain color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 for text; use Tamagui tokens and themes.
- Keyboard operability (web): all interactive components must be focusable and navigable.
- Focus visible: never remove focus outlines on web.
- Headings and landmarks: use semantic roles (`header`, `main`, `navigation`).
- Motion/animation: respect reduced motion prefs.
- Forms: label every input; show error associations.

## Web (Next.js)
```tsx
// Example Tamagui button with ARIA
<Button
  accessibilityRole="button"
  aria-pressed={false}
  aria-label="Play video"
>
  Play
</Button>
```

- Use `lang` on html, descriptive `title`, proper `<label for>` and `id`.
- Provide captions and transcripts for video/audio.
- Use `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for animations.

## Native (Expo)
```tsx
// Accessible component
<Pressable
  accessible
  accessibilityRole="button"
  accessibilityLabel="Play video"
  accessibilityHint="Starts playback of the selected video"
/>
```

- Support Dynamic Type and large text.
- Ensure hit targets ≥ 44x44 pt.
- Respect screen reader focus order.
- Provide captions/transcripts in media flows.

## Testing
- React Testing Library: assert `role`, `name` (web).
- Snapshot Tamagui themes for contrast checks.
- Manual VoiceOver/TalkBack sanity checks before releases.
