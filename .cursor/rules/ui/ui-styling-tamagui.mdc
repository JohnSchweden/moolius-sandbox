# Tamagui Styling Rules
- ALWAYS use Tamagui components and styling
- NEVER use React Native StyleSheet
- NEVER use inline styles except for dynamic values
- Use Tamagui's theming system for consistency
- Use tokens for spacing, colors, and typography

# Component Patterns
- Export from packages/ui for shared components
- Use composition over inheritance
- Include accessibility props (accessible, accessibilityLabel)
- Use Tamagui's animation APIs for transitions

# Cross-Platform Images
- Use SolitoImage for all images
- Include width/height props
- Implement lazy loading
