# Cursor Rules Analytics

Each time you use a Cursor rule, update the analytics tracking file.

File location:
```
PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/analytics.md
```

## Format

The analytics file contains a count of how many times each rule has been used:

```
rule-name.mdc: 5 [last-used: 2024-01-20, context: video-upload-feature]
another-rule.mdc: 2
```

Add new rules as needed.

# Create a .cursor/rules/features/ directory
# Group related rules for specific features
